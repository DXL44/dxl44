# hello hi 
I'm DXL44, a 20 y/o who programs does webdev in their free time. This account is mostly for my personal projects. Outside of programming I do some art and run a moderately successful [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@dxl44).

If you want to reach out to me, my discord is @DXL44. 

I know HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and C++. I technically learned Python but I'm not that great at it.
