# hello hi 
I'm DXL44, a 19 y/o currently studying computer science alongside digital arts in college. You won't really see much of that here though. This account is mostly for my personal projects. Outside of programming I do some art and run a moderately successful [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@dxl44).

If you want to reach out to me, my discord is @DXL44 - and I have a mostly complete list of other socials I use regularly [here](https://dxl44.tumblr.com/links). (I know it's not ideal, I'll work on something better put together eventually.)

I know HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I'm currently learning C++.
